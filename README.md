# Using Harbor with the vCenter Event Broker Appliance - Script repository

**Post URL:** https://rguske.github.io/post/using-harbor-with-the-vcenter-event-broker-appliance/

This repository contains the `docker_harbor_cert.sh` which is used in the above mentioned post.

> To solve this issue, IÂ´ve created a little script which downloads the root certificate from Harbor, creates the relevant directories, puts the certificate into those and restarts the docker service.
